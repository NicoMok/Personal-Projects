I've built my first neural network in the following Jupyter notebook. This notebook takes 28 x 28 pixel
images of handwritten digits and recognizes the digit printed. There are 42,000 training examples used
in this neural network.

I've used TensorFlow to build a neural network consisting of 3 layers (2 hidden + 1 output layer). 
The first layer consists of 25 neurons, the second of 15 neurons, and the final layer of 10 neurons 
(corresponding to 10 digits from 0 to 9).

For the first 2 hidden layers, I've used the ReLU activation function, while for the last layer, I've
implemented the SoftMax function. I've also attempted to implement the same neural network without
using TensorFlow (Python and Numpy only) but this is still work in progress.
